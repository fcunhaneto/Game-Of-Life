# game-of-life
This is the Game of Life a game devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game was created to reproduce by simple rules, the transition and changes in living beings groups, with applications in several areas of science.

The "game" is a zero-player game, the only thing necessary is a unique user input to define the initial state for the evolution of the cells, requiring no further input.

The rules of the game are:

1- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

It is important to understand that all births and deaths occur simultaneously. Together they constitute a generation or, as we call them, an "instant" in the life story of the complete initial configuration.
